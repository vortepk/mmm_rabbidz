### Game mechanics:
Your goal is to save as much rabbits as you can from green dude.<br/>
Left click / space key / tap to jump. Each rabbit jumps only once.<br/>
Every saved rabbit (who jumped over a dude) gives +1 to your score.<br/>
Green dude accelerates at every new level.<br/>
Only 3 rabbits is admitted to be eaten. Otherwise, game is over.<br/>
For now, there is only 9 available levels. If you pass them - you win.<br/>
