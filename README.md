# MMM, RABBIDZ
Casual HTML5 game. Modificated version of "I hate rabbits" by Thomas Palef (Lessmilk). Work in progress.<br/>
Hosted on GitHub Pages. [Play here!](https://vortepk.github.io/mmm_rabbidz/)

### Game mechanics:
Your goal is to save as much rabbits as you can from green dude.<br/>
Left click / space key / tap to jump. Each rabbit jumps only once.<br/>
Every saved rabbit (who jumped over a dude) gives +1 to your score.<br/>
Green dude moderately accelerates at every new level (but sometimes very sharply).<br/>
Only 3 rabbits is admitted to be eaten. Otherwise, game is over.<br/>
For now, there is only 9 available levels. If you pass them - you win.<br/>

### Bugs:
There is a bugs which can appear during gameplay. Don't judge strictly :smile:

### What's next?
The project is frozen due to desire to work more on my own game projects.
